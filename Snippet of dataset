These have stayed in for 4 days now and have not bothered my ears. I have not received compliments on them, my sister told me they look fake and she wouldn‚Äôt buy them. But that‚Äôs what sisters do. I think these are just fine for my purposes and will be keeping them in. Fast shipping as well"

188,"I needed help with my order, but I have yet to hear back from the owner."
189,They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry

191,Absolutely gorgeous! I've gotten so many compliments. Highly recommend!
192,"I love them! Very subtle and elegant!  It did take quite a while for me to receive them.  But since I ordered them during the holiday seasons and it's overseas shipping, I understand the delay.  The owner responded quickly to my message regarding the shipping delay.  So I am very happy with the purchase:)"
193,Very lovey petite design. I adore them! The perfect ear decor for any occasion!
194,"dispatch and packaging was impecabble and very tasteful

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!"
196,They are stunning I‚Äôm obsessed!
197,"So sch√∂n und mit dem tollen Opal ein richtiger Hingucker. Ich habe mir im Nachgang noch den passenden Armreif bestellt. 
Da man den B√ºgel leicht biegen kann, kann man die Halterung sch√∂n ans Ohr anpassen."
198,"It did ship on time and was very nicely wrapped and boxed! Lovely earrings...but the first time I attempted to put them in my ears, the post s broke off. Now I have to try to glue these tiny things on so that I can wear them...they obviously were not flexible , at all! Very disappointing. Especially because they were so important to me...the moon phases...and unique! :(:("

235,"Wore them for about two days and absolutely loved them. Unfortunately they broke as I took them off on the third day. 

Edit: The shop owner was extremely considerate and thoughtful. She reached out to me and very kindly was able to resolve the issue. I would recommend the shop to others not only because of the beautiful pieces but especially because of the kind shop owner, Claudia."

I do not have sensitive skin and always clean earrings before I wear them so I‚Äôm not sure what the issue is for me.

309,"Really nice + comfortable earrings, I love them!"
310,"Beautifully and thoughtfully packaged, shipped on time; Unfortunately the earrings don't lay completely flat upwards along the ear meaning that I had to make sure to readjust ie. reposition them onto my ear. I think gently pushing down on the bracket should help keep it in place in future. 
Still a pretty and unique piece of jewelry."

334,Earrings were poorly manufactured. Broken out of packaging. Cute concept
335,"Pretty but needed to return product to  arriving too late. Now getting frustrated trying to see if this is resolves I keep getting the ring around and people keep having.me email different folks to find out how to return these earrings,  I would not reccomend ordering from this site again if I can't get it resolved in the week ne"
336,Very nice.  Received on time as well.
337,unfortunately it broke before I could use it :(
338,"The packing was nice, but one of the earrings was bent and I still wore it; however the earring fell off and I lost it the same day i received it. The earring that was bent would not stay in my ear."
339,"This is the 4th time I‚Äôve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren‚Äôt made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you‚Äôll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear"
340,Thank you Nicole for my beautiful earrings. I haven't  taken them off since I got them because I love the way they look so simple and clean yet so timeless and chic. Thank you so much for my new favorite earrings <3<3 :-D
341,"Have had so many compliments on these ear climbers - I love them - perfect , thank you üëåüèª"
342,Beautiful earrings! I got many compliments.
343,"This is the third set of these I have purchased. I own a pair in gold and receive so many compliments, that I‚Äôve started gifting them to people who love them!"
344,"I've left a review before, but I have started to but these quite often as everyone who sees them likes them and comments on them, so I have a load in reserve to gift people. I adore these, they're perfect. I've tried buying from other makers who may be closer, but I haven't found anyone who makes them as well."
345,"I absolutely love ear crawlers, but this is hands on the most elegant pair I‚Äôve ever bought. Outstanding quality and so delicate you‚Äôd almost forget you‚Äôre wearing them!"
346,"Fair wait, light, delicate and elegant I think."
347,Beautiful. Difficult to put on ear because of the double long piece. Still love it.
348,belli.. molto comodi da usare tutti i giorni
349,So cute! Love these!
350,"wonderfull earring
fast shipping 
thank you"
351,Shipped quickly and looks beautiful!
352,I have what I consider fairly normal ears and these do not stay in place no matter what I do.  Bummed.
353,"Beautiful pair of earrings, very happy!"

356,She liked them very much.
357,She liked them very much.
358,The earrings never arrived. And the shop owner stoped answering back. Also the etsy costumer service was no help at all. Was the last time I ordered something here!!!
359,"Right now, I can only rate the item at one. I cannot properly review this item yet because it still hasn‚Äôt come in. I ordered it on November 19th and today is December 23rd. I will be very disappointed if it doesn‚Äôt come in time for Christmas.  I will be happy to change my review if it comes in before Christmas."
360,"I love ‚ù§Ô∏è them so much. I wear them constantly and that's saying a lot for me because I very rarely wear silver, usually only hold, but I am so happy with these earrings and hey are so cool looking that I've had to adjust my preferences! Haha. Definitely get tons of inquiries and compliments. So dainty and easy to put on and they look just wonderful. Very happy with my purchase."
361,"I debated whether to dock a star on this because I ran into a hassle actually getting them, but once they arrived I decided to give 5 stars because these earrings are really great! They are an ingenious design and exactly what I wanted. I needed earrings to wear sleeping/ to keep my holes open that would be comfortable and not fall out. They fit very securely and look great! Also, the seller puts them in a little bottle for presentation- so cool, and I can use the tiny bottle for something else. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase even though I ran into a snafu with actually getting them."
362,"I really liked my earrings. They're a bit bigger on me than on the model, but I do have small ears. They also arrived a bit on the late side, but I did order them during the holidays, and the shop owner was very attentive about the situation, so I'm still giving a five star review. Very pretty! And sturdy!"
363,I am so excited to have this!  Production time and shipping was just as suspected and the item is even better in person!  The back of it is a square rather than round which allows for a more natural fit especially in my second piercing.  Thank you so much! LOVE IT!
364,perfect fit love them !
365,Love it ‚ù§
366,"This my new favorite earring, it fits perfectly and is so cute! Took about a month to get here, but I expected that with international shipping."
367,"Lost my first pieces in a move, sadly, but these were too cute and I rarely wear jewelry so I'm glad to buy a new pair! Easy to put on, I only notice a slight pressure when I move my ears, but they're very secure. I love the little maintenance note and brand design, and you can tell they're made with love. Also Ara's really nice and helpful with tracking info."
368,It took a while but I finally got it! Thank you it's really pretty! :)
369,I do love this piece! I think my ears are a little too small to hold them up and in place- they tend to slip down and hang vertically. Still love them!
370,"Love it !
Thanks:)"
371,"Love this jewelry! Friends like it, referring them. Now I've always got some serotonin, even if I'm not feelin it =]"
372,love it!!!
373,I love these earrings!! I wear them almost everyday. This was my first purchase on etsy and I cannot be more satisfied. Thanks Arajera!!
374,"What can I say? It's exactly as photographed, fits exactly as expected, and came thoughtfully packaged with useful instructions for care. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
375,I love these earrings so much. They arrived in plenty of time and are absolutely gorgeous!!
376,fit comfortably and come in a cute storage bottle too.
377,"It's even prettier in real life! I love my new earring, thank you :)"
378,These earrings are beautiful and unique! Really love the small bottle they were shipped in! Thank you very much!
379,Lovely them
380,"Very well packaged, and good delivery time. Note that these earrings are not great is you have thick earlobes like mine! Going to try resizing the wire for comfort."
381,"The serotonin pair of earrings are beautiful! I love wearing these on my ears. Once you figure out how to slip them on and off your ears, they are very low maintenance during the day that I almost forget I'm wearing them. It came packaged in a small jar with a care card which also make for a cute display in my jewelry area."
382,This earring is super cute and super comfortable too! Perfect for a chem nerd like me :^)
383,"This seller is AWESOME! I contacted them about a delay in my delivery. She explained they'd had some issues with their delivery company and I could get a refund or have my parcel resent. I chose for resent and I'm so glad I did! 
The packaging alone is gorgeous! The earring is so cool! I know where I will be going for presents in the future!"
384,"Perfect earrings, shipped in a tiny glass bottle, love them!"
385,"Amazing! I love it! It fits perfectly, you can wear it all day, without any discomfort."
386,"Perfecto, es tal como aparece en la web."
387,"I LOVE THESE! I go them way before I expected them! I was worried about them not fitting but they fit perfectly! They are well made and exactly what i was hoping for! I also loved the vial that it came in, it was a very nice touch!"
388,"So nice, comes in the prettiest package"
389,I adore this item. It fits really well and it's made of high quality materials. And it arrived earlier than I expected. I've already placed another order for more!
390,"Great quality, was shipped exactly on time, love it!"
391,"It looks deceptively small when you pull it out of its package but is in fact rather large on your ear- a good thing, because it can easily be seen. Fits nicely if you have multiple piercings too, I have three and it fits nicely behind the other two."
392,"These earrings are great, and the design is pretty creative. They were shipped in a glass bottle with a cork. I think this is ingenious and much better than a box most people use."
393,I have bought THREE pairs over the last few years because I‚Äôm always losing things. But I love them that much! ‚ù§Ô∏è
394,"I put the wrong US zip code in and thought package was sent to a different address. Ara was responsive and helpful when I contacted her (turns out it was sent to the right address) Lovely earrings, makes for a great gift!"
395,Beautiful item that fits perfectly!
396,I like these ear rings! Unique and fun.
397,Beautiful and well made. Thank you so so much xxx
398,Beautiful design and really good quality!  They were worth the wait and made the best gift!
399,"Lovely unique looking earring, gets lots of admiring glances. Lovely helpful seller & arrived really quickly for reasonably priced postage :)"
400,Absolutely love these!!! Thank you!!
401,Very cute!
402,This item is adorable and comes with care instructions.  I'm not a fan of shippers that make you sign for packages as I work all week. And the post office in my area is crazy nuts all the time. It took forever to get my order because I had to be home to get it. Inconvenient! Cute product
403,"What a fun idea, making earrings of different molecules! I love ear climbers as I can't wear dangling earrings for work so these are perfect. This is the third pair I ordered. Ara does the best work. I'm sure I will order again."
404,These are so amazing!! I haven't worn earrings for years & these are just so original & simple & beautiful. Thank you!
405,"Beautiful, elegant and delicate. I love both of these ear climbers. Excellent quality !"
406,"Love this and everything I've ordered from this seller! Products came with free anti-tarnishing polishing cloth and in small glass jars to protect from tarnish. Even when Etsy sent this to my wrong old address, Ara made the effort to contact the shippers and get it sent to my right address. Wonderful experience, will be buying from this store again!"
407,It fits and hugs my ear perfectly
408,"Classy and unconventional earrings, great stuff !
The packaging is lovely !"
409,"Je trouve cette boucle tr√®s belle ! 
Discret et √©l√©gant, c'est vraiment beau."
410,"This looks great on, although it is slightly big for my ear so be careful if you have smaller ears."
411,"My ear lobes are a little small for these earrings, they stick out a bit underneath. But still look great!"
412,Unique earrings and lovely packaging. Thank you so much! :)
413,I love it! It makes me feel fashionable and feminine!
414,"Really nice quality! Arrived a little later than expected, but they traveled a long way‚ùóÔ∏èpackaged in a little bottle with care explanation. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
415,"The shipping took longer than expected (over a month), but the product and packaging were gorgeous and my mom was really pleased with this gift!"
416,Definitely so worth the wait!
417,"They're so cute, the only issue is the end of the bar (that goes behind the ear) pokes me. But I had some wax balls lying around the house and it was an easy fix!"
418,Seller is very accommodating. Good quality and quick delivery. Thanks so much!
419,"These are so fun!  My college freshman daughter chose these in lieu of getting more holes in her ears, for now at least!  Well made, good fit, arrived fairly fast!"
420,"I love it, even though I have freakishly small ears they almost fit perfectly, the bottom is just a little too big"
421,"Nice feedback quick service friendly
Nice tips for silver
Look amazing 
Can't wait to give it to my daughter"
422,The item I ordered was good quality and I was happy with it! However the earring I ordered was a little big for my earlobe. Other than that I was pleased with what I ordered.
423,"Little difficult to put on/wear, but overall very cute!"
424,"I love this, thank you so much!!"
425,"Unusual and very pretty ear cuff. 
I highly recommend!"

430,I love the seratonin earrings!
431,"I love it, thank you!"
432,"It didn't take as long as I expected to make, and arrived in California in 2 weeks. They're well made and I love them."
433,I bought a pair of these a while ago and lost one so glad I could replace it üòä
434,Super cute! I love it
435,Happy with product.

455,"These are a bit larger on my ear than pictured, but still cool"
456,Looking forward to these bad boys being in my ears
457,Love it! So do all my girlfriends that got it for Christmas!

468,My earrings arrived yesterday. They are perfect. I have received loads of compliments. Thank you :)
469,"It shipped on time, beautiful product"
470,tr√®s d√©cu ne tient pas le bijoux est trop lourd
471,"They're cute! Bigger than you'd think, and took a long time to ship (ordered May 10, shipping process started May 24, and received June 7), but I dig 'em. It really struggles to stay in the correct orientation though. It falls over unless I make it really tight (much tighter than the dopamine I also have), which kinda makes my ear bright red and hot, but price of happiness ammirite?"
472,Very beautifully made and it is very sturdy and of high quality. the only thing i would complain about is that my earlobes are too small to fit the whole thing >:
473,The item is perfect! Thank you so much :)
474,"Super cute earrings and shipping was speedy
Great transaction. Thank you!"
475,These are so cute!  Great gift!
476,Just as pictured. I've already gotten a compliment on the first day wearing it :)
477,Love the concept and I am sure my daughter will love the earring!
478,It's really comfortable and matches the description and picture.
479,"This item was exactly as described and arrived in a timely fashion.  However, I ordered a second ear cuff and was anticipating giving it as a Christmas gift to my best friend.  The shop failed to ship the second cuff, despite ordering it before their Christmas cutoff, and left me scrambling days before to find a suitable replacement gift."
480,Exactly as described. Lovely piece of jewellery.
481,it is a very cute cuff
482,"These are beautiful and nerdy. They tend to slide off my ear a bit, but I don't think they ever risk falling out."
483,Great item! Thanks so much!
484,"Just lovely, and very comfortable to wear!"
485,"A gift for my daughter, she loved this!"
486,i bought these as a birthday present for my 13 year old daughter. she loves them and people are constantly complementing her.
487,Very lovely earings thanks
488,Lovely earrings :) Thank you!
489,"Lovely item, arrived on time."
490,It was a nice presentation putting the earrings in the tube
491,"The post of this earring is too thick and doesn't fit in my pierced ear lobe. It's a shame because it's very cute and well made, but I am not able to wear it at all."
492,"Looks exactly as I expected, however the metal bar that goes through the ear was too large for my ear piercings. It was painful trying to get them in. I haven't had this issue with other earrings."
493,My ear-climbers just arrived! They are the nicest earrings I've ever owned and I couldn't be happier with them! The quality is amazing üòä
494,Sehr sch√∂ne Ohrringe! Sehen sehr edel aus. Lieferung dauerte da. 4 Wochen.
495,Ich dache es handelt sich um ein rechts links P√§rchen. Abgesehen davon sind sie sehr sch√∂n
496,"MAGNIFIQUE !!!! Merci
Un cadeau qui va ravir ma fille
Super boutique, envoi dans les d√©lais, tout est parfait;"
497,Cute crawlers. Just want I wanted!
498,I get so many compliments on these! My new earwear look for the fall!
499,"Simple but have the lingering charm, like it very much!"
500,"Beautiful! A very good Quality. 
Everything is perfect üëçüòä"
501,I love these!!  I  never take them out. They stay put where as all other earclimbers wouldn't.
502,"Love these earrings, great fit and length. I screwed up my shipping address and the customer service was amazing! Thank you!"
503,They fit perfectly and they look so cute!
504,"Its just cool looking, I keep compliments all the time!"
505,Beautiful earrings - my husband loves them even more than I do (which is a lot)!
506,Gotta love this ear bar! Highly recommended shop!
507,"I love these earrings and have been wearing them daily for about 2 months. They are comfortable, shipped within the timeframe and I get a tone of compliments on them."
508,Great pair of earrings! sleek and minimalist and just what I wanted. I'm wearing them right now!
509,Love this ear climber. I‚Äôve ordered others where the post that goes behind the ear wasn‚Äôt as robust and after repeated wearing the post would break off from tightening and loosening. This one seems like it‚Äôll hold up much better.
510,Perfect fit and adds some edge
511,Love them. Smooth elegance. The fit is comfortable and it stays in place.
512,Tr√®s contente de mon achat et envoi tr√®s rapide!
513,Love these! They are so pretty and comfortable to sleep with too
514,Quality and at a great price ‚ù§Ô∏è
515,Receive so many compliments on these unique earrings!
516,Gave these as a gift. They're perfect and look great.
517,"Conforme √† la photo, parfait! merci"
518,Very thin! Just as I expected. If you‚Äôve ever worn an earring like this you may have to adjust the width to keep it secure and I can do that with this earring with out fear of it snapping or losing its proper shape.
519,"Shipping kinda took a while, which I expected but they are great! They sometimes catch on my hair and slip off my ear but they‚Äôre so easy to slide back into place."
520,Very nice minimalist style. Unique and good price. They fit perfectly. Thank you!
521,My new favorite earrings! The perfect everyday pair!
522,"Tr√®s, (trop selon moi) discret..! Conforme √† la description cependant !"
523,Very cute and fits nicely!
524,Tr√®s beau produit ! :-)
525,Very cool. Had to give mine away to my friend from Norway. So unique and the also stay in well.

528,"extremely cute and stylish, thank you for the fast shipping as well!!"

530,Beautiful piece. I can't stop wearing them!
531,My friend loved these for her Christmas present!!
532,perfect.  just what I asked for.
533,Very light and more confortable than I expected. I'm very pleased.
534,Still waiting to receive these earrings for my daughters 30th Birthday.
535,"I saw the crawler trend a while ago and decided I'd hop onto it. I absolutely fell in love with the earrings as soon as I received them, and I've liked them more and more every day. I have worn them every day and gotten numerous compliments. They are inexpensive yet unique. I honestly would recommend this shop to a friend :)"
536,"Absolutely love these! I received the order in less than 2 days, and it looks exactly like pictured! I will definitely buy more from this shop. Really really cute items. :)"
537,"I get compliments on these star climbers every time I wear them! It was a tiny learning curve getting them in (I‚Äôm old), but I love them!"
538,Absolutely love them!!
539,I bought these and the leaf ones - love them both. They¬¥re super pretty and no problem to slip on. They stay in place nicely.
540,"Minimal and perfect for anyone. Earrings are light weight, which I like and made well. Will buy again!"
541,Yaaaas! Love them!
542,The jewelry is so unique and shipping was quick especially for overseas !!! Would recomend to others üíïüíïüíï
543,Earrings came SUPER FAST & are SUPER CUTE. I get compliments at least once/day. Will definitely be buying more soon!
544,New favorite pair of earrings! They are a little bit on the flimsy side in my opinion so I am careful with them but absolutely love them overall!
545,"Gorgeous! This is my first set of ear climbers, and I love mixing and matching them with other earrings for asymmetrical looks. <3"
546,"I got a pair of Moon Phases and a pair of Stars. I decided to wear one of each. They are so cute, I love them!"
547,Love these dainty star ear climbers!  They also shipped super fast :)
548,"Love everything about this star crawler. It‚Äôs beautiful and easy to put on. Also came super quick! I loved it so much, I bought it in silver as well."
549,Order was shipped the day I placed the order!!! I thought maybe that it was just the label being created but the package came almost two weeks early! Love how speedy this was especially with it being the holidays. Very happy with the purchase and the maker/seller. I've been wearing my pair for well over a year and they're still looking great and this pair was bought for a friend who constantly adores me earrings.
550,My earrings came today and I loooove them. They actually shipped the day I ordered them and they came super fast. They are really lightweight and comfortable! Would buy again!
551,"Beautiful earrings, I‚Äôve received many compliments!! Great quality too!!"

558,I got complements on these the first day I wore them! They look great and fit great! Some of the best ear crawler earrings I've purchased!
559,"I received them this afternoon & put them on on the way to a dinner - noticed & loved by family right away. The earrings are simple, effortless but dress up the outfit easily."
560,I am delighted with these cute little earrings! They are so comfortable. They arrived quickly and were securely packaged. I would add a pic but they look exactly as pictured by the seller.
561,These earrings are beautiful!!  Took a bit of time to get them but worth it in the end.  Thanks much!!! Joules
562,"Love these earrings! I've never tried wearing ear climbers before, and they were so easy to put on. They look gorgeous."

574,Super cute but already lost one dandet!!
575,"Crazy long shipping, no fault of seller.  USPS is crazy right now. Cute earrings!"
576,They are beautiful and we love them!
577,"I love it, so beautiful to wear it everyday"
578,"We love these! I ordered a different set from another company and had to pay for each climber separately, so getting the set for the price paid made them both beautiful and affordable!"
579,"Cute! They came a little squished and I had to reshape them, and they lose their shape pretty easily when I sleep, but for the price I can deal with that!"
580,Great little ear-pins. Love 'em!
581,Very cute! The back of the earring is longer than I expected but I think it makes it better functioning to be honest. Highly recommend it‚Äôs a nice set of earrings :)

595,"Super cute, glad I got these."
596,Super cute and really affordable!
597,It's beautiful my granddaughter loves it
598,These are so cute! Dainty but not so delicate that I feel like I am going to break them every time I put them in.
599,"These earrings are amazing, they fit my ears perfectly and sometimes, unlike with regular earrings, I don't even feel these on my ear! These are amazing thank you so much!"
600,Cute! As pictured/ described. The quick delivery is appreciated. It would be nice to have earring stops at the back to prevent slippage. Thanks!
601,"These are so cute, just what I wanted!"
602,Beautiful earrings! I love them!
603,"Cute 
Great for young girls"
604,"Shipped within a day and took a week to get to me which is pretty good for times like these. The earrings are so pretty and seem strong even though they look delicate. The only thing is, my ears are super sensitive and usually handle .925 sterling silver with no problem but these agitated my ears. I'd recommend buying these ear crawlers if you have sturdy ears but maybe shop elsewhere if you're prone to irritation."
605,I really want to give it a five but they keep falling down my earrings and the silver have chipped and I really really really love them. I'm just so disappointed with what happened to them. But I still love them and this has been my experience.
606,Good quality and good price. Will be back for more!
607,Good quality and good price. Will be back for more!

611,Simple but beautiful! Fast shipping
612,"These are super cute.  I thought the stars might be too small, but they're perfect.   They are easy to wear and look adorable.   I'm only a little worried too much back and forth with the metal might break it, but so far they've been pretty durable; I've work them several times already."
613,Beautiful! Got compliments on them!
614,Really cute earrings and perfect for the 4th of July! Shipped super fast too :)
615,Teens loved the earrings I previously purchased. Came back to purchase different styles for their Easter baskets
616,Earrings were exactly as described! Fast shipping! Will definitely be a repeat customer.
617,Really cute!  Unique way of wearing earrings.  I love them!
618,My teens love these. I ordered more items after this purchase
619,Love the way they lay on the ear !
620,I really like this one. It‚Äôs cute and elegant
621,"Fast shipping, cute and well made"
622,Service was outstanding and product quality is great!
623,Great earring. Different and look amazing.

629,"Came very quickly!  The ear pins are very dainty and lovely.  Unfortunately, one fell out of my ear yesterday and I was unable to find itüò¢.  Will order another pair!"
630,Exactly like the photo! And very comfortable! Definitely would recommend
631,"It‚Äôs so cute..in theory. In practicality it ended up not fully formed out of the mold, one stud was jagged and snagged when trying to put into my ear. The stars aren‚Äôt as precisely cut, and I ended up taking a file to smooth out the edges & stud. They also don‚Äôt really stay in position, needing to be adjusted often. Again, really cute, so I‚Äôm working with them, but not as I was expecting."
632,They look great and timely delivery
633,These are so very cute...Love them!
634,Pretty and simple. I've gotten lots of compliments on them.
635,"Love them so much I bought a second pair as a gift for a friend -- she loves them, too!"
636,They are very cute. Dainty and sweet.
637,Both gifts were appreciated by their recipients!  Very swift shipping appreciated by me :)
638,Second purchase because I loved this so much!

Seller was transparent and gave me the option to cancel the order,  which I declined because the earrings were exactly what I wanted.

820,"Tan bellos aretes!! Me encanta Los mucho!
I had to wait a bit since earrings were coming from overseas but they were worth the wait! Everyone compliments me on these earrings. I love that the back jacket has three different holes in which to place the front piercing....that way the jacket looks good for all different shapes of earlobes."
821,Edgy and fierce. Love these! Slow shipping but hey it's coming from overseas! Worth the wait. I get compliments every time I wear them.
822,"I saw this design in an Etsy promotional email, and I knew I had to have it! It's the first earring with a jacket that I had ever seen, and I love how delicate it looks. People say it looks like spikes, but it looks like a star with its beams of light to me. I love it so much. The earrings and the jacket are both well made and sturdy. Despite being based in Spain, they shipped quickly and arrived within a week!"
823,"These are beautiful earrings that give just enough interest to an outfit. I love wearing them with just regular tees or with casual dresses. I got them in gold and they perfectly complement my boyish pixie cut. 

Lalia quickly shipped my purchase the day after I ordered them, but because she's based in Spain, it took about a week and a half to get to the U.S. (just to give you a heads up). The earrings are well worth the wait though, I promise!!"
824,"They‚Äôre cute. However they are completely uneven, and do not fit each ear even remotely evenly. Also if you have sensitive skin beware, this material will give you complications if you have metal sensitivies. They also fall out a lot. But at least they‚Äôre cute!"
825,Love these earrings.  They are beautifully made and the ability to adjust them is genius to achieve the perfect fit.  This was my first purchase from this seller and I am so happy to have found this lovely shop!
826,"With three settings for how low the spikes hang from the stud this fits perfectly around my ear.  Very happy with how it looks and with only a little difficulty lining it up the first time I wore them I've found it very easy to put in and take out, it's very easy to hold while lining it up."
827,"These are just great, really original looking. Speedy shipping. Only downside is that they're fiddly as hell to put on, but that's not a flaw in these earrings, just what you get with this style! Would definitely purchase from here again."
828,Totally in love with the jewelry + fast delivery!
829,"I‚Äôm SO happy with these earrings! Dainty, yet edgy. Not too big. Great quality. Just awesome. I‚Äôll be coming back to this seller again and again, thank you!!!"
830,I loved theseüíïüòç
831,"It came exactly as described! I love it. My ears are very sensitive to different types of material and these earrings don't irritate them at all. Great customer service, shipped fast, beautiful earrings. Definitely 5 stars!"
832,Love these earrings! This was my 2nd time ordering and gifting family members who liked them after seeing me wear them. They LOVE them. This took an extremely long time to receive (due to COVID) but it was worth the wait.
833,"The wait was worth it! Blown away by the quality, Bylia! 100% will buy again."
834,"I bought this gift for my petite niece's 40th birthday. Before receiving them I was a little nervous about how well they would fit but there are three holes at the back of the earring which allow for some adjustment and this was not a problem. They arrived with me, in the U.K., from Spain, in 4 working days which was great. My niece was delighted to have such an usual pair of earrings. I thought them elegant, well made, high quality and, finally, nicely presented and I would recommend this item. I couldn't have asked for more, many thanks. Tina"
835,These are crazy wonderful! I just love them! Gives just that subtle edge.

951,I haven‚Äôt gotten this item in the mail yet it‚Äôs been almost a month
952,"This seemed to take a long time to arrive, but it did arrive toward the end of the time frame given. The clasp of one earring did not stay on and the 3 pieces fell apart easily. After several communications and sending requested pictures of the earring, the seller did identify the problem and outline a way for me to fix it. Seller always replied to my comments within 1 business day. However, it was frustrating to have to go through a ""fix it"" process at all."
953,They are SO cute! I got my husband‚Äôs initials and they are so well made and I am beyond happy with my purchase! üíó
954,I absolutely love my earrings!  I love that my twinkies‚Äô first name initials will always be with me üíô‚ù§Ô∏è

1047,Fast shipping and great product!
1048,"These earrings hurt my ears.... I've never been sensitive to jewelry, especially genuine silver and gold, but there's something in the material of these that isn't just silver or gold."
1049,Super sweet earrings. Bought them as a gift and the person looooved them!
1050,LOVE! getting more for gifts!
1051,"Super cute, great gift idea"
1052,Item was exactly what I was looking for. Shipped quickly.
1053,"I LOVE this ear cuff. üòç It is absolutely stunning and easily the most beautiful piece of jewelry I own. Plus, the sizing and dimensions were just right for my ear. There‚Äôs a post for pierced ears on the bottom and a wrap around clamp for the cartilage on top. I wore this as a part of a ‚Äúqueen‚Äù costume at an event where I was dancing all night and the cuff stayed on really well... which is saying a lot cause I really move my head around when I dance. It did get a bit painful on the top, especially when it got brushed while hugging people, but the clamp is adjustable, so loosening it did help a bit. It‚Äôs so beautiful, though, that it was worth any discomfort. Also, I paid for 1-3 day shipping and it did take a week to come to the States, so just be sure to plan accordingly. It‚Äôs worth the wait!"
1054,"Absolutely LOVE the cuff. It fits perfectly and stays in place. Customs were rediculously expensive though, but it's still a really beautiful ear accessory!"
1055,"Vraiment d√©√ßue et choqu√©e par la qualit√© du produit √©tant donn√© son prix. 
Sans oublier que le facteur √† ma porte m‚Äôa factur√© 47‚Ç¨ de ‚Äúfrais de douane‚Äù alors qu‚Äôils ne sont mentionn√©s nulle part dans l‚Äôannonce!!!
Attention, ne vous faites pas avoir!!!!"
1056,Beautiful craftsmanship! Simple and elegant. I‚Äôm very happy with this piece!
1057,Absolutely gorgeous earrings. I love that there's an adjustable clasp at the top portion to keep the earrings in place! The only drawback is that they took a little less than a month to arrive (overseas shipping).
1058,Very beautiful ear climber and matching stud. Fantastic quality. Would absolutely buy again.
1059,So beautiful.. üòç..I will rate the seller 10/10..A+++
1060,Love them! The perfect pretty show stoppers for my sister's wedding.
1061,I am so happy with these earrings. I‚Äôll be wearing these on my wedding day and can‚Äôt wait to show them off! Thank you!
1062,Love these earrings!  Will add some unique sparkle to different outfits.
1063,En attente de commande! C‚Äôest un scandale
1064,Very beautiful piece. I‚Äôm very excited to wear it in Palm Springs!
1065,"I ordered these in rose gold and then messaged the shop on the same day of purchase to see if I could actually request the same ones in silver instead. The shop owner confirmed that this was possible and asked me to provide a link to the color I wanted, which I did.

I ordered them at the end of December for an event on February 1st. They just arrived and they‚Äôre beautiful but they‚Äôre rose gold instead of silver. Because the shipping took so long, I won‚Äôt be able to have this corrected in time for my event. My fault for changing the color but I am bummed that the shop owner wasn‚Äôt able to make the correction after confirming."
1066,"Thank You for changing my order for me , I really appreciate it. The ear crawlers are really pretty!"
1067,"So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc√©‚Äôs wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It‚Äôs so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use."
1068,I can‚Äôt stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it‚Äôs one of the prettiest rings I‚Äôve ever seen. My fianc√© is very proud of it and I‚Äôm a very happy fianc√©e. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
1069,"This ring looks so amazing! I‚Äôve never seen a prettier ring, and my now fianc√©e absolutely loves it! The picture doesn‚Äôt do it justice. It looks so much better in person. I could not be happier about my purchase."
1070,"Words can‚Äôt even describe how impressed I was! At first I was skeptical ordering a ring without seeing it in person. However I‚Äôm so glad I did! Lena was amazing throughout the whole process! My boyfriend and I picked out this ring together as my engagement ring, but has not yet proposed, so waiting to officially wear it! Highly recommend this shop! They were very flexible with payments and doing custom sizing. Couldn‚Äôt have had a better experience!"
1071,"I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here‚Äôs what my (now) fianc√©e had to say:

‚ÄúThis ring is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven‚Äôt had it on a full 24 hours and can‚Äôt even count how many people have said ‚Äòthat is by far the most beautiful ring I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äô‚Äù"
1072,"Love love love love love. The top photo shows the contrast in direct sunlight, and the bottom is inside. Depending on the lighting the grey will be more pronounced. (The colors seen in the bottom photo are from a stained glass window reflecting nearby!) I absolutely love this ring and am so glad we chose to order from Lena. She answered any and every question I had and the ring took only 3 days to arrive once shipped. After spending weeks looking for a salt and pepper diamond, I was thrilled to come across this listing. If you are even considering a salt and pepper diamond, do not hesitate to inquire about this beauty!"
1073,"From the fianc√©:
 
I found Lena on Etsy several years ago while browsing for jewelry, and instantly fell in love with her beautiful rings. Even before dating my now-fianc√©, I dreamily ‚Äúfavorited‚Äù this emerald engagement ring, thinking that someday I‚Äôd be engaged to the love of my life with this ring on my finger. I can‚Äôt believe that day has finally come! It is even more beautiful in-person and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with Lena‚Äôs craftsmanship! Most importantly, the ring has special significance to me knowing that it was handmade in Israel where I was born, spent the first five years of my life, and still visit to see family. Thank you, Lena, for being a part of this memorable time in our lives!"
1074,"I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my rings! Lena worked so hard to make sure my wedding band fit perfectly with my engagement ring - and was extremely prompt and easy to communicate with. She is so genuinely kind and went above and beyond in ensuring that I was completely thrilled with my rings. Our wedding day was perfection!! Lena is creative, sweet, and thoughtful! I love my rings!"
1075,"Lena from sevencaratshop was incredibly helpful in helping me acquire this ring for my now fianc√©e. All of her jewelry looks great and is easy to find on her Etsy page. She had it sized and shipped halfway across the world in minimal time, I was able to propose much earlier than anticipated. The quality of the diamond is pristine, such an exquisite cut I even find myself taking closer looks at it! Of course she said yes, and now the only thing shining brighter than the ring is my gorgeous fianc√©es smile. She loves showing it off and it‚Äôs all thanks to Lena at sevencaratshop! I will be a repeat customer in the future for sure!"
1076,"The whole process of selecting a ring, custom designing it, delivering etc. has been amazing with Lena. The ring itself is stunning and I could not be happier with it. My partner is in love with it, she thinks that it is the perfect ring. She has compliments everywhere we go.
I cannot speak highly enough of Lena's customer service, despite being nervous about ordering online I felt I had better customer service than buying from a shop. I would 100% to recommend SevenCaratShop to anyone looking for beautiful unique jewelry. 
Thank you Lena, you have been amazing!"
1077,"I received my diamond ring and I was absolutely delighted with the quality and workmanship! I tried to capture its brilliance in the photo, the diamond is stunning! I am very pleased, and so is my husband! I will not hesitate to purchase again from Lena!"
1078,Lena is great to work with! She created a custom order so I could have a wedding ring that fit perfectly with my engagement ring!
1079,"From the fianc√©e- It's absolutely gorgeous! It took about two weeks to ship, and then it arrived within 4 days. It fits perfectly and the stones are exactly what I wanted. My fianc√© proposed at the zoo, and the polar bear came up to admire the ring immediately. We also got some wonderful photos of the sea lions swimming by to take a peek! I'm so happy with this ring, I can't stop staring at it and I'm so happy we went with Lena! Thank you for creating such a beautiful engagement ring that I'll wear and cherish forever!"
1080,"Absolutely beautiful ring! I was very apprehensive about buying without seeing but Lena was very communicative and I‚Äôd read all the reviews beforehand. It‚Äôs so stunning! The halo ring means a lot to me as I sadly lost my Dad in May and I wanted something beautiful to look at every day that reminds me of my lovely,  shining star. Thank you Lena x"
1081,Absolutely beautiful ring! Can‚Äôt stop staring at it and constantly get compliments on it. Would Never go to another jeweler. She takes excellent care with my jewelry and goes out of her way to make sure it‚Äôs perfect!
1082,"I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the custom set that Lena built for me! Pictures don‚Äôt do it justice, it is so beautiful and I couldn‚Äôt be more in love with it! Lena was amazing to work with and made the process of purchasing something so important and an international purchase a little less intimidating. She really did everything she could to ease any anxiety about such a big purchase that I was never able to see in person until it arrived. Thank you so much!"
1083,"Really nice piece. Fast shipment. Very nice people to do business with. Lena really went above and beyond my expectations of customer service. 

Only thing, I wish I would have realized the size. It appears larger than it is in the photo, but my mistake, as the size is listed in the description. I have attached a photo. Wish I had a better photo to send, but I'm behind on posting a review as I received this more than a months ago. The chain in the photo is my own. It was not purchased with the pendant. 

Moving forward, I can overlook the size, as it really is a beautiful piece that attracts a lot of compliments. Thank you Lena for your awesome customer service!!  üëåüèºüòò"
1084,I just received my rings! I was pretty nervous ordering such a high dollar item on the internet but I will buy all of my jewelry from Lena at SevenCarat! The rings are absolutely stunning and everything I had hoped!
1085,"Lena made a beautiful ring! It is exactly what I hoped. Everyone thinks it's quite beautiful and elegant. The experience of her helping design it was quite easy, and I got exactly what I wanted! Thanks!"
1086,I love this ring and so does my Fianc√©. The fact it is hand made and the diamonds are not conflict stones really appealed to me. The design looks really elegant. The customer service was outstanding. They even allowed me to make payments on the ring. They're awesome thank you guys
1087,"She said YES to her dream ring! She loves it, thank you!!"
1088,Beautiful pair of diamond earrings.  I love them.  Thank you so much ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
1089,"I can,t speak highly enough of Lena,s personal level of service and communication. Absolutely beautiful earrings, couldn,t be happier!"
1090,"So impressed with this ring, and most importantly, so was my (now) fiance! The ring absolutely stuns, totally sparkles in the light. The small diamonds are perfect, as is the main diamond.

Diamond has no visible inclusions, and the price was such a tremendous value.

Lena contacted me within hours of setting up the order, got the ring in roughly 10 days which was fantastic!

Could not be happier, thank you so much!"
1091,I got this as a gift to myself and I absolutely love it! I get compliments all the time. I'm not a good enough photographer to show how beautiful this is. If I ever want to splurge on me again I know where to go.
1092,Love the detailing. Don't care for how they sit in the ear. Delivery was great.
1093,"I was immensely impressed with Lena's craftsmanship. The ring was exactly what I wanted. 

I was having so much trouble finding something that met my budget and also spoke to me. 

I even had a crazy delivery deadline and Lena did everything in her power to get my order all the way to Canada in time for my flight to San Francisco to ask my girlfriend to marry to me. 

(She said yes, by the way).

Blown away by Lena's customer service and artistry. Could not have asked for more.

Thank you so very much.

-Carolyn from Canada :)"
1094,"Its more beautiful in reality than the picture, can't be more happier with service and the product, my wife felt like queen today, I awfully thank you."
1095,"After much searching, my fianc√©e and I were glad to find Lena's Sevencaratshop. Lena's designs are beautiful, elegant and timeless. 

Lena went to considerable lengths to make sure my fianc√©e was happy with the gold diamond engagement ring I purchased, demonstrating great care not only in her craftsmanship but also for her customer's satisfaction. 

Thanks, Lena, for helping to make our engagement a pleasant one. We greatly appreciate you and your work!"
1096,Love my ring! Lena was so easy to work with and had great communication. Highly recommended!
1097,"The garnet stud earrings set in 14K white gold were gorgeous! The stones were superior quality, very deeply colored and clear. The goldwork was truly professional.
The gift box was beautiful and so was the luxe gift bag.
Delivery was swift, and secure (I had to sign for the package). 
I loved the idea that these earrings were handmade and not mass produced. That made them extra special.
Most of all, my daughter LOVED them!
I would recommend Lena at SevenKarat without hesitation.
Thank you very much, Lena! üíñüíñüíñ"
1098,First I was uncertain to order a diamond ring online. I was scared to get scammed. But now Im so glad to trusted Lena. The ring is even more beautiful life. Lena was always answering me fast. I can remmonded everyone who isn¬¥t sure to buy a ring online. And the price/performance ratio is great. Thank you so much Lena!!!
1099,"Very fast shipping considering the ring came from Israel. I liked that the seller used Fedex vs the postal service.

The ring is gorgeous! It has incredible sparkle! It is difficult to believe this ring is just 1 carat as it looks like a 3 carat ring. I also like that the band of the ring gets slightly wider in the back. I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase! I‚Äôm wearing it as an anniversary ring."
1100,"After reviewing the various engagement rings available on Etsy, I stumbled across Lena's 1 ct diamond engagement ring with my partner (now fianc√©e) and we both instantly impressed at how beautiful it looked after reading the description and viewing the photos available online!  After contacting Lena for guidance on how to arrange a payment plan, she responded back straight away and was an absolute pleasure to deal with the whole way through the process right up until the ring was shipped out to me in Australia and arrived safely and securely in an extremely quick turnaround of 3 business days. I was absolutely thrilled with the ring when it arrived, it truly does look amazing, and due to the excellent service I received from Lena, my fianc√©e has now decided to purchase my engagement ring online from Sevencaratshop too!"
1101,Lena was a pleasure to work with and the rings are simply stunning. The design is so unique and intricate. Thank you so much for my fianc√©‚Äôs dream ring!
1102,"This ring set is absolutely beautiful. It adds an incredible sparkle to the finger, and is sure to pick up compliments from strangers. Pictures can't do it justice! Not to mention Lena was so helpful throughout the shipping process!"
1103,This ring is even more beautiful than pictured. Love my new ring.
1104,An absolutely beautiful engagement ring. My partner adores it. The diamond catches the light beautifully and it‚Äôs all round a gorgeous ring.
1105,"Really pretty emerald ring. Lena was super helpful and was very diligent in finding the right emerald for me. I love working with her in all my purchases :) 
Thank you Lena!"
1106,Nothing but great things to say. Item arrived earlier than expected and packaged very well. Leading up to the purchase I had many questions that were answered timely. I needed a custom size and with a quick message we got everything set up. This was a wonderful experience.
1107,"It is absolutely beautiful! Thank you so much for your amazing work!
Wonderful customer service!
